# Weather forecast app

This application is a weather forecast app that gets its data from the [Meteorologisk Institutt API](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0).


## Swift and Xcode

This project is built using Xcode 12.4 and Swift 5 

## Usage

In order for the application to work it is reliant upon access too the internet and the user granting access to the device / simulator's location services. 

If the app is being run on a simulator, make sure that it's location is set to 'custom location'. If the location is set to 'none' the application will not be able to fetch the data required to run correctly.

## Icons
I have chosen to use the [yr weather icons](https://github.com/nrkno/yr-weather-symbols) as referred to by The Meteorological Institute as it saved me from having to spend time finding appropriate icons myself, and then renaming them. I have, however, chosen a single icon from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), as referred to by the project description, to depict when/that there is no data available - this in the application's forecast screen. 


## Code
If or when code is written that is inspired or influenced by code or tutorials found online, it will be referred to via comments in the code files where said code appears, like so:
```
// reference to asset
code {}
